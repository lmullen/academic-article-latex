#	Changelog

## v0.2 2012/03/20 ##

+ Moved many calls to packages into the sample document. This is
  necessary to make it easy to switch a documents class from, say,
  `academic-article` to `article` just by editing `\documentclass`.
+ Added options to chose between Adobe Caslon Pro and Minion Pro as the
  font for the article.
+ Changed the `\section` and `\subsection` command to be italic, the
  same size as regular text, and centered (for A heads) or left aligned
  (for B heads).
+ Moved most metadata into separate section at the start of the
  document, making it easier to change without editing preamble.
+ Now uses `biblatex`.
	
## v0.1 2011/08/15 ##

+ Initial release
